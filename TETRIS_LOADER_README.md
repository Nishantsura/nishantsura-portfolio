# Tetris Loading Component Integration

## Overview
The Tetris loading component has been successfully integrated into your React portfolio project. It provides a fun, animated loading experience using falling Tetris pieces.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `src/components/ui/tetris-loader.tsx` - Main Tetris loading component
- `src/components/ui/tetris-loader-demo.tsx` - Demo component showcasing different variations
- `TETRIS_LOADER_README.md` - This documentation file

### Modified Files:
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added loading state with Tetris animation
- `src/App.tsx` - Added demo route

## Component Features

### Props Interface:
```typescript
interface TetrisLoadingProps {
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'        // Size of the grid and cells
  speed?: 'slow' | 'normal' | 'fast' // Animation speed
  showLoadingText?: boolean        // Show/hide loading text
  loadingText?: string             // Custom loading text
}
```

### Size Configurations:
- **sm**: 8x16 grid, small cells (w-2 h-2)
- **md**: 10x20 grid, medium cells (w-3 h-3) - **Default**
- **lg**: 10x20 grid, large cells (w-4 h-4)

### Speed Configurations:
- **slow**: 150ms intervals
- **normal**: 80ms intervals - **Default**
- **fast**: 40ms intervals

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:
```tsx
import TetrisLoading from "@/components/ui/tetris-loader";

<TetrisLoading />
```

### Custom Configuration:
```tsx
<TetrisLoading 
  size="lg" 
  speed="fast" 
  loadingText="Loading Portfolio..." 
/>
```

### Without Loading Text:
```tsx
<TetrisLoading showLoadingText={false} />
```

## Integration Details

### 1. Portfolio Loading Screen
The component is integrated into your main portfolio page (`src/pages/Index.tsx`) as a loading screen that displays for 2 seconds when the page first loads.

### 2. Demo Page
A demo page is available at `/tetris-demo` that showcases all three size and speed variations of the component.

### 3. Responsive Design
The component automatically adapts to light/dark themes and is fully responsive.

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies:
- ✅ React 18 (already installed)
- ✅ TypeScript (already installed)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS (already installed)
- ✅ No additional dependencies required

### Key Features:
- **Game Loop**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- **Piece Rotation**: Random rotations for variety
- **Line Clearing**: Animated line clearing when rows are completed
- **Grid Reset**: Automatic reset when grid gets too full
- **Theme Support**: Works with both light and dark themes
- **Performance**: Optimized with `useCallback` and proper cleanup

### Animation Details:
- Tetris pieces fall from the top of the grid
- Pieces rotate randomly when spawned
- Completed lines are cleared with a pulse animation
- Grid resets automatically when it gets too full
- Smooth transitions and scaling effects

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- ✅ React 18+ required
- ✅ CSS Grid and Flexbox support needed

## Performance Considerations
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal performance
- Proper cleanup of animation frames on unmount
- Memoized callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Lightweight implementation with minimal DOM manipulation

## Customization
The component can be easily customized by:
1. Modifying the `TETRIS_PIECES` array to change piece shapes
2. Adjusting the `sizeConfig` and `speedConfig` objects
3. Customizing the CSS classes for different visual styles
4. Adding new props for additional functionality
